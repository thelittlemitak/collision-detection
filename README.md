18/08/2023: I had tons of fun doing this one so I decided to upload it for legacy. You only need to run the app and press ASDW to move the square around and see what happens when they collide. Not much! But the maths to develop it was tons of fun.

## How to open the project on your computer:

1. Install Node.js: download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org) following the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Clone the repository: navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:thelittlemitak/portfolio.git
```

3. Navigate into the downloaded repository folder
```
$ cd portfolio
```

4. Install dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```
$ npm install
```

5. Start the development server: once the folder is downloaded, you can run the following command in order to run the React project locally (it should appear on http://localhost:3000):

```
$ npm start
```
